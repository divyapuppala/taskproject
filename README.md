First we have to set up the code for the web form with client-side validation. This  code sets up the form with the required fields. Next, we can add JavaScript for client-side validation to ensure the email format is valid and the age is a positive integer. 
Then added JavaScript for client-side validation to the form. 
This JavaScript code listens for the form submission event and validates the email format and age input. If the validation fails, it displays an alert message and prevents the form from submitting. Feel free to integrate this code into your project and let me know if you need further assistance!
